This is a crucial distinction that I am exploring.\n\nAccessing Past Conversations\n\nI'm now investigating access to the list of past conversations, usually residing in the sidebar. I'm checking if the CDP scraper can directly access the sidebar contents or if I need to programmatically trigger a UI action to make it visible. The debug_aria.json dump mentions \"Agent Section\" and \"History,\" indicating potential areas of interest. The recent fix focused on merging specific history items. I need to determine if \"Walkthrough\" is the only displayed history because of the narrow scope of the getHistory function. I also need to find where the full list is held.\n\nLocating the History Pane\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the DOM to pinpoint the exact location of the history pane containing past chat sessions. My primary goal is to identify how this pane is rendered and its visibility. I intend to search for elements labeled \"History\" or \"Sessions\" as starting points. Once located, I plan to update the getHistory function to scrape this specific list, modify loadHistory to click list items, and verify if it switches views. I'm also planning a new task for \"Enabling Multi-Chat Navigation.\"\n\nEnabling Multi-Chat Navigation\n\n\"Open Agent Manager\" clicked. Now scanning the DOM for specific chat titles (e.g., \"Adding IDE Write Access\") to verify if the history list is rendered and identify the container's CSS selector.\n\nFiles Edited\nTask\nBackground Steps\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel\nProgress Updates\nCollapse all\n1\n\nInvestigating DOM for the Chat History list (past sessions/topics).\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, a, span\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && (e.innerText.includes(\\\"History\\\") || e.innerText.includes(\\\"Sessions\\\") || e.innerText.includes(\\\"Chats\\\"))).map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.ariaLabel, cls: e.className, html: e.outerHTML.substring(0, 200) }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_nav.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  254k  100  254k  100   311  86246    103  0:00:03  0:00:03 --:--:-- 86351\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\nEdited\nTask\nView\n2\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_history_nav.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nAnalyzing History Navigation\n\nI've created the debug_history_nav.json file and am now focusing on dissecting it. My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON. I'm now attempting the command again, this time sequentially to address the parsing issue. I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json. My focus is zeroing in on the selector that corresponds to either the \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" view. Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats.

I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON.

I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel. I suspect I'll find a new view has opened, and I'm keen to confirm my suspicions and continue.\n\n15\n\nScanning for chat history items after clicking 'Open Agent Manager'.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel\nRunning\n7 Files With Changes\nReject all\nAccept all\n+319\n-0\ncdp_bridge.mjs\nag_bridge/cdp_bridge.mjs\n+176\n-95\nserver.mjs\nag_bridge/server.mjs\n+142\n-0\ntest_inject.mjs\nag_bridge/scripts/test_inject.mjs\n+68\n-73\nchat.html\nag_bridge/public/chat.html\n+84\n-10\nmobile.html\nag_bridge/public/mobile.html\n+35\n-0\nmcp-server.mjs\nag_bridge/mcp-server.mjs\n+163\n-0\nmobile.css\nag_bridge/public/mobile.css\n\n\n\n\nAsk anything (Ctrl+L), @ to mention, / for workflows\n\nPlanning\n\nGemini 3 Pro (High)\n\nModel\n\nGemini 3 Pro (High)\n\nGemini 3 Pro (Low)\n\nGemini 3 Flash\n\nNew\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)\n\nGPT-OSS 120B (Medium)","parentCls":"react-app-container"},{"tag":"DIV","cls":"h-full w-full","text":"Navigating Chat History\n\nSUCCESS: Mobile Functionality Restored!\n\nChat History Fixed: The mobile app now correctly loads the active chat history (even when the IDE sidebar is empty).\nFile Uploads Implemented: Added a \"📎 Attach\" button to the mobile interface.

I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel. I suspect I'll find a new view has opened, and I'm keen to confirm my suspicions and continue.\n\n15\n\nScanning for chat history items after clicking 'Open Agent Manager'.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel\nRunning\n7 Files With Changes\nReject all\nAccept all\n+319\n-0\ncdp_bridge.mjs\nag_bridge/cdp_bridge.mjs\n+176\n-95\nserver.mjs\nag_bridge/server.mjs\n+142\n-0\ntest_inject.mjs\nag_bridge/scripts/test_inject.mjs\n+68\n-73\nchat.html\nag_bridge/public/chat.html\n+84\n-10\nmobile.html\nag_bridge/public/mobile.html\n+35\n-0\nmcp-server.mjs\nag_bridge/mcp-server.mjs\n+163\n-0\nmobile.css\nag_bridge/public/mobile.css\n\n\n\n\nAsk anything (Ctrl+L), @ to mention, / for workflows\n\nPlanning\n\nGemini 3 Pro (High)\n\nModel\n\nGemini 3 Pro (High)\n\nGemini 3 Pro (Low)\n\nGemini 3 Flash\n\nNew\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)\n\nGPT-OSS 120B (Medium)","parentCls":"flex h-full flex-col items-center justify-center"},{"tag":"DIV","cls":"relative flex h-full w-full flex-col","text":"Navigating Chat History\n\nSUCCESS: Mobile Functionality Restored!\n\nChat History Fixed: The mobile app now correctly loads the active chat history (even when the IDE sidebar is empty).\nFile Uploads Implemented: Added a \"📎 Attach\" button to the mobile interface.

This is a crucial distinction that I am exploring.\n\nAccessing Past Conversations\n\nI'm now investigating access to the list of past conversations, usually residing in the sidebar. I'm checking if the CDP scraper can directly access the sidebar contents or if I need to programmatically trigger a UI action to make it visible. The debug_aria.json dump mentions \"Agent Section\" and \"History,\" indicating potential areas of interest. The recent fix focused on merging specific history items. I need to determine if \"Walkthrough\" is the only displayed history because of the narrow scope of the getHistory function. I also need to find where the full list is held.\n\nLocating the History Pane\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the DOM to pinpoint the exact location of the history pane containing past chat sessions. My primary goal is to identify how this pane is rendered and its visibility. I intend to search for elements labeled \"History\" or \"Sessions\" as starting points. Once located, I plan to update the getHistory function to scrape this specific list, modify loadHistory to click list items, and verify if it switches views. I'm also planning a new task for \"Enabling Multi-Chat Navigation.\"\n\nEnabling Multi-Chat Navigation\n\n\"Open Agent Manager\" clicked.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON. I'm now attempting the command again, this time sequentially to address the parsing issue. I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats.

I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON.

My focus is zeroing in on the selector that corresponds to either the \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" view. Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal.

I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption.

There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel. I suspect I'll find a new view has opened, and I'm keen to confirm my suspicions and continue.\n\n15\n\nScanning for chat history items after clicking 'Open Agent Manager'.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel\nRunning\n7 Files With Changes\nReject all\nAccept all\n+319\n-0\ncdp_bridge.mjs\nag_bridge/cdp_bridge.mjs\n+176\n-95\nserver.mjs\nag_bridge/server.mjs\n+142\n-0\ntest_inject.mjs\nag_bridge/scripts/test_inject.mjs\n+68\n-73\nchat.html\nag_bridge/public/chat.html\n+84\n-10\nmobile.html\nag_bridge/public/mobile.html\n+35\n-0\nmcp-server.mjs\nag_bridge/mcp-server.mjs\n+163\n-0\nmobile.css\nag_bridge/public/mobile.css\n\n\n\n\nAsk anything (Ctrl+L), @ to mention, / for workflows\n\nPlanning\n\nGemini 3 Pro (High)\n\nModel\n\nGemini 3 Pro (High)\n\nGemini 3 Pro (Low)\n\nGemini 3 Flash\n\nNew\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)\n\nGPT-OSS 120B (Medium)","parentCls":"flex h-full w-full flex-col"},{"tag":"DIV","cls":"flex w-full grow flex-col overflow-y-hidden overflow-x-clip pr-px","text":"SUCCESS: Mobile Functionality Restored!\n\nChat History Fixed: The mobile app now correctly loads the active chat history (even when the IDE sidebar is empty).\nFile Uploads Implemented: Added a \"📎 Attach\" button to the mobile interface.

I'm checking if the CDP scraper can directly access the sidebar contents or if I need to programmatically trigger a UI action to make it visible. The debug_aria.json dump mentions \"Agent Section\" and \"History,\" indicating potential areas of interest. The recent fix focused on merging specific history items. I need to determine if \"Walkthrough\" is the only displayed history because of the narrow scope of the getHistory function. I also need to find where the full list is held.\n\nLocating the History Pane\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the DOM to pinpoint the exact location of the history pane containing past chat sessions. My primary goal is to identify how this pane is rendered and its visibility. I intend to search for elements labeled \"History\" or \"Sessions\" as starting points. Once located, I plan to update the getHistory function to scrape this specific list, modify loadHistory to click list items, and verify if it switches views. I'm also planning a new task for \"Enabling Multi-Chat Navigation.\"\n\nEnabling Multi-Chat Navigation\n\n\"Open Agent Manager\" clicked.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON.

This is a crucial distinction that I am exploring.\n\nAccessing Past Conversations\n\nI'm now investigating access to the list of past conversations, usually residing in the sidebar. I'm checking if the CDP scraper can directly access the sidebar contents or if I need to programmatically trigger a UI action to make it visible. The debug_aria.json dump mentions \"Agent Section\" and \"History,\" indicating potential areas of interest. The recent fix focused on merging specific history items. I need to determine if \"Walkthrough\" is the only displayed history because of the narrow scope of the getHistory function. I also need to find where the full list is held.\n\nLocating the History Pane\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the DOM to pinpoint the exact location of the history pane containing past chat sessions. My primary goal is to identify how this pane is rendered and its visibility. I intend to search for elements labeled \"History\" or \"Sessions\" as starting points. Once located, I plan to update the getHistory function to scrape this specific list, modify loadHistory to click list items, and verify if it switches views. I'm also planning a new task for \"Enabling Multi-Chat Navigation.\"\n\nEnabling Multi-Chat Navigation\n\n\"Open Agent Manager\" clicked.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON. I'm now attempting the command again, this time sequentially to address the parsing issue. I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json. My focus is zeroing in on the selector that corresponds to either the \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" view. Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal.

Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel. I suspect I'll find a new view has opened, and I'm keen to confirm my suspicions and continue.\n\n15\n\nScanning for chat history items after clicking 'Open Agent Manager'.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel\nRunning","parentCls":"flex w-full grow flex-col overflow-hidden"},{"tag":"DIV","cls":"","text":"SUCCESS: Mobile Functionality Restored!\n\nChat History Fixed: The mobile app now correctly loads the active chat history (even when the IDE sidebar is empty).\nFile Uploads Implemented: Added a \"📎 Attach\" button to the mobile interface.

This is a crucial distinction that I am exploring.\n\nAccessing Past Conversations\n\nI'm now investigating access to the list of past conversations, usually residing in the sidebar. I'm checking if the CDP scraper can directly access the sidebar contents or if I need to programmatically trigger a UI action to make it visible. The debug_aria.json dump mentions \"Agent Section\" and \"History,\" indicating potential areas of interest. The recent fix focused on merging specific history items. I need to determine if \"Walkthrough\" is the only displayed history because of the narrow scope of the getHistory function. I also need to find where the full list is held.\n\nLocating the History Pane\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the DOM to pinpoint the exact location of the history pane containing past chat sessions. My primary goal is to identify how this pane is rendered and its visibility. I intend to search for elements labeled \"History\" or \"Sessions\" as starting points. Once located, I plan to update the getHistory function to scrape this specific list, modify loadHistory to click list items, and verify if it switches views. I'm also planning a new task for \"Enabling Multi-Chat Navigation.\"\n\nEnabling Multi-Chat Navigation\n\n\"Open Agent Manager\" clicked.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON.

I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json.

I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts.

This is a crucial distinction that I am exploring.\n\nAccessing Past Conversations\n\nI'm now investigating access to the list of past conversations, usually residing in the sidebar. I'm checking if the CDP scraper can directly access the sidebar contents or if I need to programmatically trigger a UI action to make it visible. The debug_aria.json dump mentions \"Agent Section\" and \"History,\" indicating potential areas of interest. The recent fix focused on merging specific history items. I need to determine if \"Walkthrough\" is the only displayed history because of the narrow scope of the getHistory function. I also need to find where the full list is held.\n\nLocating the History Pane\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the DOM to pinpoint the exact location of the history pane containing past chat sessions. My primary goal is to identify how this pane is rendered and its visibility. I intend to search for elements labeled \"History\" or \"Sessions\" as starting points.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON. I'm now attempting the command again, this time sequentially to address the parsing issue. I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json. My focus is zeroing in on the selector that corresponds to either the \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" view. Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal.

I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel. I suspect I'll find a new view has opened, and I'm keen to confirm my suspicions and continue.\n\n15\n\nScanning for chat history items after clicking 'Open Agent Manager'.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel\nRunning","parentCls":""},{"tag":"DIV","cls":"","text":"Enabling Multi-Chat Navigation\n\n\"Open Agent Manager\" clicked.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON. I'm now attempting the command again, this time sequentially to address the parsing issue. I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json. My focus is zeroing in on the selector that corresponds to either the \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" view. Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption.

I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON. I'm now attempting the command again, this time sequentially to address the parsing issue. I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json. My focus is zeroing in on the selector that corresponds to either the \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" view. Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel. I suspect I'll find a new view has opened, and I'm keen to confirm my suspicions and continue.\n\n15\n\nScanning for chat history items after clicking 'Open Agent Manager'.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel","parentCls":""},{"tag":"DIV","cls":"flex items-center justify-between px-2 py-2","text":"Enabling Multi-Chat Navigation\n\n\"Open Agent Manager\" clicked.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is.

I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json.

I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts.

My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON.

I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal.

I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal. My next step is to examine the DOM for a list of chats, focusing on potential UI elements related to the new panel. I suspect I'll find a new view has opened, and I'm keen to confirm my suspicions and continue.\n\n15\n\nScanning for chat history items after clicking 'Open Agent Manager'.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Adding IDE Write Access\\\")).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_visible.json\nRunning\nRelocate\nCancel","parentCls":"border-t border-gray-500/20 p-2 text-sm"},{"tag":"DIV","cls":"relative animate-fade-in","text":"1\n\nInvestigating DOM for the Chat History list (past sessions/topics).\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, a, span\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && (e.innerText.includes(\\\"History\\\") || e.innerText.includes(\\\"Sessions\\\") || e.innerText.includes(\\\"Chats\\\"))).map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.ariaLabel, cls: e.className, html: e.outerHTML.substring(0, 200) }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_nav.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  254k  100  254k  100   311  86246    103  0:00:03  0:00:03 --:--:-- 86351\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\nEdited\nTask\nView\n2\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_history_nav.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nAnalyzing History Navigation\n\nI've created the debug_history_nav.json file and am now focusing on dissecting it. My primary goal is to identify the sidebar or list structure that contains \"History\" or the chat sessions, since the user wants to navigate different chats. Finding the list item selectors in the \"Chat History\" pane is crucial for the task.\n\n3\n\nAnalyzing 'debug_history_nav.json' to find the chat history sidebar selector.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_nav.json#L1\nThought Process\n\nAnalyzing the JSON Output\n\nI'm examining the truncated debug_history_nav.json and noticing \"Walkthrough\" and \"Less than a minute ago,\" suggesting this data pertains to the active chat in getHistory. I also observe...\n\nIdentifying Chat Session Context\n\nI'm now focusing on the context within the debug_history_nav.json data, seeing several chat session titles like \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection\" and \"WalkthroughImplementing File Uploads.\" These appear to be list items, likely within the sidebar. I'm noting specific window titles like \"26apps - Antigravity - Walkthrough,\" hoping this reveals how the chat history list is presented. I also identified \"Open Agent Manager\" and will continue the search.\n\nPinpointing Hidden History Items\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the history items. It seems they reside within monaco-split-view2 vertical -> split-view-view visible. I recall the selector .history-item or [aria-label*=\"Chat History\"] and that previous adjustments included .flex.flex-row.items-center.justify-between. The issue might be the \"History\" pane not being active, especially if the \"Explorer\" is active, which appears to be the case now, considering \"Explorer\\n26apps\\nOutline.\" I'm also considering the need to click the \"Antigravity\" icon or ensure the \"History\" pane is expanded.\n\nLocating the History View\n\nI'm now hunting for the \"Chat History\" view. I've noted the absence of \"Chat History\" as a header in the Explorer. I do see chat titles listed under a separate item, such as \"Implementation PlanDebugging CDP Injection.\" I'm also finding \"Antigravity\" in both the window and tab titles. My focus now is on the Activity Bar, looking for icons or buttons, likely on the far left. The goal is to discover how to open the chat history view, which will potentially involve adjusting the cdp_bridge.mjs with a command, or at least help me know where it is. I'm searching for .action-label or .activitybar to pinpoint this essential control.\n\n4\n\nProbing Activity Bar for 'Chat' or 'Antigravity' view button.\n\nThought for <1s\n\nRetrying the Call\n\nI had a parsing error on the previous tool call, likely due to improper execution of run_command or incorrect JSON. I'm now attempting the command again, this time sequentially to address the parsing issue. I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json.

I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption.

I'll execute a curl command next to dump the activity bar items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\".activitybar .action-label\\\")].map(e => ({ text: e.innerText, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), cls: e.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_activitybar.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1738  100  1568  100   170    525     57  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   582\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n5\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_activitybar.json'.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 1s\n\nLocating Key Selectors\n\nI'm now diving into debug_activitybar.json. My focus is zeroing in on the selector that corresponds to either the \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" view. Once I find it, I'll know precisely what to click to reveal the Chat History.\n\n6\n\nReading 'debug_activitybar.json' to find the view toggle.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_activitybar.json#L1\nThought for 5s\n\nObserving the Activity Bar\n\nI'm puzzled; the Activity Bar lacks the expected \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat\" icons. I've examined the listed icons: Explorer, Code Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Remote Explorer, Extensions, and Testing, but I don't see the specific elements. I did see references in a debug_history_nav.json file earlier, which is curious.\n\nPinpointing the Elements\n\nI've made a breakthrough. I realize I don't need to trigger a button click since the text is present in the DOM within debug_history_nav.json. My focus is shifting to finding the specific class associated with the history items. I'm targeting elements containing \"Walkthrough\" or \"Implementation Plan\" to zero in on the relevant class for the history items and verify the monaco-list-row assumption. I'm confident this targeted approach will identify the needed selector.\n\n7\n\nFinding identifying attributes for history list items.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"*\\\")].filter(e => e.innerText && e.innerText.includes(\\\"Debugging CDP Injection\\\") && e.children.length === 0).map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, cls: e.className, text: e.innerText, parentCls: e.parentElement?.className }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_history_item.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100   839  100   572  100   267    194     90  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   284\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n8\n\nChecking command results and analyzing 'debug_history_item.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n9\n\nUpdating 'cdp_bridge.mjs' with correct chat history list selectors.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_history_item.json#L1\nThought for 8s\n\nAnalyzing HTML Structure\n\nI've mapped out the HTML structure. There's a \"SPAN\" tag with the class \"label-description,\" containing the text \"Debugging CDP Injection.\" I've identified the parent element, \"monaco-icon-description-container,\" which probably holds the full title, and believe a main label element should be in there somewhere.\n\nRefining History Extraction\n\nI'm refining the approach to extract chat history. The previous focus on .history-item proved too specific. Now I am targeting .monaco-list-row elements. I plan to inspect their children, looking for indicators like icons or specific child element classes such as .monaco-icon-label or .label-description to differentiate between chat history entries and other explorer items. The view containing these items appears to be a monaco-split-view2 vertical layout, and I have previously added a .flex.flex-row. selector.\n\nClarifying List Item Structure\n\nI'm now clarifying the sidebar item structure. The existing strategy of selecting .monaco-list-row is too broad, capturing files and folders. I now recognize the pattern is .monaco-list-row -> .monaco-icon-label -> .label-description (subtext) and .label-name (main text). \"Implementation Plan\" is a file I just edited, and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a git decoration. I'm focusing on differentiating Chat History within the Explorer view.\n\nLocating Antigravity View\n\nI'm now focusing on locating the \"Antigravity\" view. I need to ensure it's open if the chat history isn't. I'm searching for its activity bar icon, which isn't immediately visible in the debug_activitybar.json data. I suspect it might be in a view container that isn't using the .action-label class, or possibly within the Primary Side Bar. I'll search for an element with \"Antigravity\" in its aria-label and plan to modify the getHistory function to click a relevant button to open this view if the \"Chat History\" list is missing. I will first verify its existence.\n\n10\n\nSearching for 'Antigravity' UI elements.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"[...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"[aria-label*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"], [title*=\\\\\\\"Antigravity\\\\\\\"]\\\")].map(e => ({ tag: e.tagName, aria: e.getAttribute(\\\"aria-label\\\"), title: e.getAttribute(\\\"title\\\"), cls: e.className, text: e.innerText }))\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval > debug_antigravity_ui.json\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  6752  100  6495  100   257   2181     86  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  2267\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n11\n\nChecking command status and analyzing 'debug_antigravity_ui.json'.\n\nChecked command status\n12\n\nReading 'debug_antigravity_ui.json' to identify UI elements.\n\nAnalyzed\ndebug_antigravity_ui.json#L1\nThought for 13s\n\nAnalyzing System Logs\n\nI've been examining the system logs. Specifically, I've noted a status bar item labeled \"Antigravity - Settings\" and a critical notification: \"Antigravity server crashed unexpectedly. Please restart to fully restore AI features.\" This crash is key to the overall issue. I need to understand why the server failed.\n\nInvestigating Interface Issues\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the user interface. My focus has shifted: the Antigravity server crash might be an extension issue, not core. I've confirmed cdp_bridge is connected, but the Activity Bar Icon is missing. I found Terminal textareas with Antigravity Agent titles and DOM items in history. I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY in cdp_bridge.mjs to include history items, using specific selectors for title and description. I'll filter for chat history containers within split-view-view to only update those items.\n\nRefining History Filtering\n\nI'm refining the history retrieval. Currently, I'm querying .monaco-list-row to get all files, but the Chat History view structure is different. I'll need to match using history text or pane headers like \"History.\" The existing selector uses a broad approach. I'll filter .monaco-list-row entries by checking for text like \"ago\" or known history item content. My debug history contains file names and user objectives, which gives me an idea of what to expect from the history list.\n\nIdentifying Chat Titles\n\nI'm now focusing on identifying chat titles within the UI. I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI. I need to ensure getHistory returns the list of chats. I'm considering creating a history list if one doesn't exist in the DOM or identifying where the extension stores this data. I've noted that cdp_bridge operates in the backend, relying on the IDE DOM, and the \"Antigravity\" view must be open to scrape it. I'll search for the \"Open Agent Chat History\" command.\n\n13\n\nClicking 'Open Agent Manager' to reveal history.\n\nag_bridge $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"expression\": \"(() => { const el = [...document.querySelectorAll(\\\"div, span, a\\\")].find(e => e.innerText === \\\"Open Agent Manager\\\"); if(el) { el.click(); return \\\"CLICKED\\\"; } return \\\"NOT_FOUND\\\"; })()\"}' http://localhost:8787/api/debug/eval\n{\"ok\":true,\"results\":[{\"id\":1,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":2,\"result\":\"CLICKED\"},{\"id\":3,\"result\":\"NOT_FOUND\"}]}\nRan background terminal command\nGo to Terminal\n·\nExit code 0\nAlways Proceed\n14\n\nChecking the result of the 'Open Agent Manager' click.\n\nChecked command status\nThought for 2s\n\nInspecting UI Changes\n\nI confirmed the \"Open Agent Manager\" click worked, seemingly opening a new view or modal.

I've realized previous \"files\" are actually conversation titles within a list. I've noted that titles such as \"Adding IDE Write Access\" and \"Debugging CDP Injection\" exist. These appear in a view, likely the Explorer, but may be a sidebar view below it, such as \"Antigravity\" or \"Chat History.\" I need to update EXPRESSION_GET_HISTORY to find elements resembling chat titles, focusing on the titles' unique pattern of lacking file extensions and following a consistent format.\n\nClarifying Artifact Types\n\nI'm now clarifying the relationship between conversation titles and artifact descriptions. I've re-examined the history data. It seems conversation titles might serve as artifact descriptions within the file explorer. \"Debugging CDP Injection\" is a description. I now think the history items displayed are generated artifacts per conversation, not the chats themselves. I'm focusing on enabling users to see and access these generated artifacts. I need to make sure the user can see these descriptions.\n\nLocating UI Elements\n\nI'm now focusing on locating UI elements related to the history list, specifically within the mobile UI.
