# GravityRemote Bridge v1.3

Antigravity Bridge (AG Bridge) is the core connectivity layer for the **GravityRemote** mobile experience. It provides a robust WebSocket and CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) link between your mobile device and the Antigravity IDE.

## 🚀 version 1.3 (MCP-First Release)

This release focuses on hardening the system for "MCP-First" workflows, ensuring that the mobile agent is as reliable as the desktop interface.

### New Features

#### 1. 🟢 Reliability & Hardening
- **Race Condition Fix**: Solved "System Error" failures where successful message injections were misread as failures.
- **Active Frame Discovery**: The bridge now actively hunts for the chat input across all iframes (`DOM.getDocument`), ensuring it works deeply nested within the IDE.
- **Auto-Retry**: Injection logic now retries 3 times with backoff if the IDE is busy or reloading.

#### 2. 🎨 "Green Theme" Aesthetics
- **Visual Feedback**: The chat interface now features a green accent theme (`#4caf50`).
- **Typing Indicator**: A new "Agent is working..." animated indicator appears instantly on send, providing immediate reassurance.

#### 3. 📂 Built-in Session Management
- **Chat History**: Browse and load past conversations directly from the mobile drawer.
- **New Chat**: Added a **+ New** button to instantly clear the current session and start fresh.
- **Filesystem-Based**: History is read directly from your `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain`, ensuring 100% persistence.

## Installation & Usage

   ```bash
   npm install
